#Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate. Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.
# Pattern:
# ask user for length of Fibonnaci
# start counter to length_number -1
# run fibonnaci 

fib_length = int(raw_input("I'm going make Fibonnaci for you! How long should the sequence be, 5 10 or 100 numbers long?\nOnly use real numbers"))
counter = 0

x = 1
y = 1

print x
print y

while counter <= (fib_length-3):
	result = x + y
	print result
	x = y
	y = result
	counter += 1
